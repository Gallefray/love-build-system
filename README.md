Love Build System
=================

This is	a set of scripts and or	Makefiles for building love2D applications to different  
targets. Some of this code is mine, some of it belongs to [josefnpat](http://www.twitter.com/josefnpat). I've tried my  
best to	keep everything extensible where possible, but you will need some extra  
programs in windows to provide basic POSIX functionality such as wget. Blame  
Bill Gates and the Microsoft development team for the lack of cool and useful stuff  
in NT. :S
